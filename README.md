# Hey there!

Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile. I have quite a few public repositories that I've set up here and there to practice new skills/demonstrate proficiencies, feel free to check them out.

There are a few repositories that are not public, however, mostly for security of my own projects or academic integrity (some of them were made for school and contain a lot of code I wrote that could be used for existing courses). The two most notable are:
- **Portfolio:** This is my personal website where all my projects are linked. Because it's live and it's one of the first projects I used git for (I most likely have some sensitive information in my commits), I've chosen to keep it private.
- **Operating System:** For my OS course, I built a working operating system simulator.
- **R8R (Social Network):** For my SE course, I helped built a social network based on ratings.

For any recruiters looking at my profile, I am willing to open up any of these repositories for you so that you can see the work I've done. Please email me at [ckmontesano@gmail.com](mailto:ckmontesano@gmail.com) if this is the case.

## Collaboration
I am always open to collaborate with people so long as there is a good idea. You can reach me at the above email if you'd like to collaborate on a projet or if you need help with something.
